# Project Happy Thoughts API

The task was to build an API in Node using Express. Also to model the database using Mongoose models and to store the data in the database.

The backend is connected to my previous frontend project "Happy thoughts" and it was modified to use the new API.

The API is deployed to Heroku and database MongoDB Atlas cloud.
